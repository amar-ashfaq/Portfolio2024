        <p class="intro-about-context">
          I am a Software Developer with over three years of commercial
          experience. I am highly passionate about front-end development and
          learning about the latest technologies.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-about-context">
          My passion for development goes way back to my days at college where I
          started writing code for the first time. The logical thinking, problem
          solving and creativity was enough for me to want to pursue further. It
          was at this point I knew I wanted to become a Software Developer.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-about-context">
          Fast-forward, I went to University and did a Computer Science degree
          along with a year in commercial Software Development.

        <p class="intro-technologies-context">
          During my time at University and over the course of my three years of
          commercial development I have accumulated experience across a wide
          range of technologies. I'm mostly self-taught.
